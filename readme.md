health = 0(Dead) to infinite, 100 in the start, can be upgraded
speed = 0 (Very slow) to +100(very fast)
strength = 0 (very weak) to +100(very strong)
    if one gets more strength, usually the speed
    gets reduced and vice versa.
krit_rate = 0(no critical strikes possible) to 100 (crit every time)
accuracy = 0(every strike hits) to 100(no strike hits)
shielding = 0(no shielding) to 100 (full shielding), is not an attribute of the character, but rather of the equipped shield, or other protection.

    standart attacks:
    punch = 1-3 damage (math function with strength), krit_damage 8-11
    kick = 2-5 damage (math function with strength), krit_damage 10-14
