As of right now, atlcantica is an unfinished text adventure.

At the moment functional:

Open menu:
    Create new game,
    load old game,
    remove game,
    close menu

Go in every direction,
rest (does no really do anything yet),
pickup items,
equip items, unequip items,
drop Items,
list inventory,
quit (saves the game and exits),
inspect (See all items in current Chunk),
help (print all available commands),
eat (removes item from inventory and adds
nutrition value of item to saturation value of the player).

Currently the main part of contributions go to the network fork of the project. Goal of the network fork is to implement a stable client server model and implement multiplayer.
